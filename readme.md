# Smart Contract repo of the Crowd Records project

Crowd Records is a decentralized platform for music creation that allows musicians to collaborate, share skills, and monetize their work. Our platform allows for the creation of music in a decentralized way by tokenizing musical ideas and contributions, turning each song into a blockchain asset that can be monetized by its creators. With Crowd Records, musicians can build on each other's ideas, remove barriers of risk, time, money and knowledge, and handle copyright and rights management in a legal and efficient way. The platform also handles copyright and rights management, offers a new way of funding song creation, and allows for legal auditing and enforcement. Additionally, it offers a crowdfunding model where fans and industry professionals can purchase equity in the song in the form of song tokens. Investments can be used to pay contributors or finance future additions. Overall, Crowd Records aims to make it easier for musicians to collaborate and share their skills while also providing a new way to fund and monetize music.
