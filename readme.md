# Smart Contract repo of the Crowd Records project

CrowdRecords is a platform that helps musicians collaborate, create music together, and monetize their work.

The platform tokenizes song ideas and musical contributions and allows musicians to use each other's ideas trustlessly. It also removes legal and financial barriers of making music by handling copyright proof, rights management, and royalty payments.

Finally, CrowdRecords allows fans and industry professionals to invest in a song by buying tokens, which can be used to pay the creators or to develop the song.

Overall, Crowd Records makes it simpler for musicians to work together and make money from their music.
